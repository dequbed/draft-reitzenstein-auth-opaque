   A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism family using the asymmetric password-
                   authenticated key agreement OPAQUE
                draft-reitzenstein-kitten-opaque-latest

Abstract

   This specification describes a family of Simple Authentication and
   Security Layer (SASL, RFC4422) authentication mechanisms based on the
   OPAQUE asymmetric password-authenticated key agreement (PAKE)
   algorithm.

   They offer two distinct advantages over the SCRAM family of
   mechanisms.  The underlying OPAQUE algorithm provides the ability for
   clients to register without the servers getting access to the clear
   text password of an user, preventing password exfiltration at
   registration.  Secondly a successful authentication produces a long-
   term secret key only known to the client that can be used to access
   encrypted server-side data without needing to share keys between
   clients via a side-band mechanism.

   When used in combination with TLS or an equivalent security layer
   these mechanisms allow for secure channel binding.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   This specification describes a family of authentication mechanisms
   called OPAQUE, based on the asymmetric PAKE of the same name.  The
   mechanisms provide strong mutual authentication and allow binding the
   authentication to an pre-existing underlying encrypted transport.

   OPAQUE as specified in this document is a Simple Authentication and
   Security Layer (SASL) mechanism compatible to the bridge between SASL
   and the Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface
   (GSS-API) called "GS2" [RFC5801].  This means that the mechanism can
   be used as either a SASL mechanism or a GSS-API mechanism.

   The OPAQUE algorithm provides the following features which this
   mechanism makes use of:

   *  The authentication information stored in an authentication
      database on the server is not sufficient to impersonate the
      client.  It is additionally salted and bound to a private key of
      the server, making pre-stored dictionary attack impossible.

   *  Successfull authentication does not grant the server enough
      information to impersonate the client.

   *  Mutual authentication is implicit and required.  A successfull
      authentication always strongly authenticates both sides of the
      exchange.

   *  A successfull authentication provides both parties with an
      emphemeral shared secret.  This secret has high entropy and can be
      used to establish a trusted encrypted channel without deriving
      trust from a 3rd party.

   *  A successfull authentication additionally provides the client with
      a constant secret.  This secret is only known to the client and
      the same for every authentication.  It can be used to e.g. store
      encrypted data on the server without having to manage keys
      locally.

3.  OPAQUE Algorithm Overview

   The Authenticated Key Exchange defined by OPAQUE consists of three
   messages -- KE1, KE2 and KE3 -- send by the client (KE1, KE3) and
   server (KE2) respectively.  A client knows the outcome of the
   authentication after receiving KE2, the server after receiving KE3.

   The following is a description of a full SASL OPAQUE authentication
   exchange.  Nothing in OPAQUE prevents sending the first client
   response with the SASL authentication request as defined by an
   application protocol ("initial client response").  See [RFC4422] for
   more details.

   The OPAQUE client starts by being in posession of an username and
   password.  It uses the password to generate a KE1 structure as per
   OPAQUE [I-D.irtf-cfrg-opaque], and sends it and the username to the
   server.  The server retrieves the corresponding authentication
   information, i.e. registration record, OPRF seed, server private key,
   and the key-stretching function (KSF) parameters used at
   registration.  It uses the first three to generate a KE2 structure as
   per OPAQUE [I-D.irtf-cfrg-opaque] and sends that, channel binding
   data (if any) and the KSF parameters to the client.

   The client authenticates the server using KE2 and the KSF parameters,
   also showing the integrity of the channel binding data in the
   process, and generates a final KE3 it can return to the server.

   The three messages KE1, KE2 and KE3 are generated using the following
   functions specified in OPAQUE [I-D.irtf-cfrg-opaque]:

KE1 := ClientInit(password)

KE2 := ServerInit(server_identity, server_private_key, server_public_key, record, credential_identifier, oprf_seed, KE1, client_identity)

KE3 := ClientFinish(client_identity, server_identity, KE2)

   The values of client_identity and server_identity are set to:

   client_identity := client-first-message + "," + client_public_key

   server_identity := server-message-bare + "," + server_public_key

   With the values and encodings of the remaining parameters per the
   OPAQUE specification, and + indicating concatenation.

   Upon receipt of KE3 the server can validate the authentication
   exchange including integrity of the channel binding data it sent
   previously, and extract a session key that strongly authenticates the
   client to the server.

4.  OPAQUE Mechanism Names

   An OPAQUE mechanism name is the string "OPAQUE-" followed by an
   uppercase identifier for the cryptographic primitives being used.
   The identifier is limited to 7 octets (20 - len("OPAQUE-") -
   len("-PLUS")) which is too short to contain the full names of all
   cryptographic primitives used.  Thus OPAQUE mechanisms using new
   groups of primitives SHOULD be registered with IANA to allow
   implementers to identify all required primitives.

   The PLUS suffix is only used when the authenticating parties support
   channel binding.  If the server supports channel binding it SHOULD
   advertise both the "bare" and "plus" version of whichever OPAQUE
   variant it support.  If the server does not it will only advertise
   the "bare" version.

5.  OPAQUE Authentication Exchange

   C: n,,n=user,r=<ke1>
   S: c=<cbdata>,i=<params>,v=<ke2>
   C: p=<ke3>

   First, the client sends the "client-first-message" containing:

   *  A GS2 header consisting of a flag indicating channel binding
      support and usage, and an optional SASL authorization identity.

   *  The authentication ID (AuthID) of the user.

   *  OPAQUE KE1, containing the OPRF credential request, a nonce, and
      an ephemeral public key.

   In response the server sends the "server-message" containing:

   *  An encoding of requested channel binding data

   *  Parameters for the KSF that needs to be used by the client

   *  OPAQUE KE2, containting the OPRF credential response, a nonce, and
      an ephemeral public key.

   *  A MAC proving the integrity of the exchange so far and
      cryptographically authenticating the server to the client (also
      contained in KE2)

   The client then recovers a long term private key and client-only
   export key from the OPRF response using the defined KSF with the
   user-provided password and parameters sent by the server.

   To finalize the authentication a client sends a "client-final-
   message" containing itself a MAC over the exchange (in KE3), thus
   cryptographically authenticating the client to the server.

5.1.  OPAQUE Attributes

   This section details all attributes permissible in messages, their
   use and their value format.  All Attributes a single US-ASCII letters
   and case-sensitive.  The selection of letters used for attributes is
   based on SCRAM [RFC5802] to make it easier to adapt extensions
   defined for SCRAM to this mechanism.

   Note that similar to SCRAM the order of attributes is fixed for all
   messages, except for extension attributes which are limited to
   designated positions but may appear in any order.  Implementations
   MUST NOT assume a specific ordering of extensions.

   *  a: This is an optional attribute and is part of the GS2 [RFC5801]
      bridge between GSS-API and SASL.  Its specification and usage is
      the same as defined in [RFC5802], Section 5.1.

   *  n: This attribute specifies the name of the user whose password is
      used for authentication (aka "authentication identity" [RFC4422]).
      Its encoding, preparation, and usage is the same as defined in
      [RFC5802], Section 5.1.

   *  m: This attribute is reserved for future extensibility.  In this
      version of OPAQUE its presence in a client or server message MUST
      cause authentication failure when the attribute is parsed by the
      other end.

   *  r: This attribute specifies a base64-encoded serialization of the
      KE1 message as specified by [OPAQUE].

   *  c: This REQUIRED attribute specifies the base64-encoded GS2 header
      and channel binding data.  Its specification is the same as
      defined in [RFC5802], Section 5.1, however it is sent by the
      server to the client instead of the other way around as in SCRAM.

   *  i: This attribute specifies base64-encoded parameters for the KSF
      to be used.  The format of the parameters is specific to the KSF
      in use.

   *  v: This attribute specifies a base64-encoded serialization of the
      KE2 message as specified by [OPAQUE].

   *  p: This attribute specifies a base64-encoded serialization of the
      KE3 message as specified by [OPAQUE].

   *  Further as of now unspecified mandatory and optional extensions.
      Mandatory extensions are encoded using the "m" attribute, optional
      attributes may use any unassigned attribute name.  Unknown
      optional attributes MUST be ignored upon receipt.

5.2.  SASL Mechanism Requirements

   This section describes the required information for SASL mechanisms
   as laid out in [RFC4422], Section 5.

   1) "OPAQUE-A255SHA" and "OPAQUE-A255SHA-PLUS"

   2a) OPAQUE is a client-first mechanism

   2b) OPAQUE does not send any additional data to indicate a successful
   outcome.  All authentication exchanges take 3 messages regardless of
   success.

   3) OPAQUE can transfer authorization identities from the client to
   the server.

   4) OPAQUE does not offer security layers but allows channel binding.

   5) OPAQUE uses a MAC to protect the integrity of the entire
   authentication exchange including the authzid.

6.  Channel Binding

   OPAQUE supports binding the authentication to an underlying secure
   transport.  Support for channel binding is optional, therefore the
   usage of channel binding is negotiable.

   The negotiation of channel binding is performed as defined in
   [RFC5802], Section 6 with the following differences:

   *  The non-PLUS and PLUS variants of the mechanism are instead named
      OPAQUE-<variant> and OPAQUE-<variant>-PLUS respectively.

   *  As it is the server who sends the channel binding data the client
      is responsible to verify this data by constructing the expected
      value of the "c=" attribute and comparing it to the received one.
      This comparison SHOULD be implemented to be constant-time.

6.1.  Default Channel Binding

   'tls-exporter' is the default channel binding type for any
   application that do not specify one.

   Servers MUST implement the 'tls-exporter' [RFC9266] channel binding
   type if they implement any channel binding and use TLS.  Clients
   SHOULD implement the 'tls-exporter' [RFC9266] channel binding type if
   they implement any and use TLS.

   Servers MUST use the channel binding type indicated by the client, or
   fail authentication if they do not support it.

7.  OPAQUE-A255SHA(-PLUS)

   TODO: Define one set of primitives; probably OPAQUE-A255SHA(-PLUS),
   using HKDF, HMAC, ristretto255, SHA-512 and Argon2i(d?)

8.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification is written in Augmented Backus-
   Naur Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234].  The non-
   terminals "UTF8-2", "UTF8-3" and "UTF8-4" are defined in [RFC3629].

   The syntax is based in large parts on [RFC5802], Section 7, which may
   be referenced for clarification.  If this specification and [RFC5802]
   are in conflict, this speification takes priority.

   Used definitions from [RFC5802] are reproduced here for convenience:

   ALPHA = <as defined in RFC 5234 appendix B.1>
   DIGIT = <as defined in RFC 5234 appendix B.1>
   UTF8-2 = <as defined in RFC 3629 (STD 63)>
   UTF8-3 = <as defined in RFC 3629 (STD 63)>
   UTF8-4 = <as defined in RFC 3629 (STD 63)>

   attr-val        = ALPHA "=" value
                    ;; Generic syntax of any attribute sent
                    ;; by server or client

   value           = 1*value-char

   value-safe-char = %x01-2B / %x2D-3C / %x3E-7F /
                    UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
                    ;; UTF8-char except NUL, "=", and ",".

   value-char      = value-safe-char / "="

   printable       = %x21-2B / %x2D-7E
                    ;; Printable ASCII except ",".
                    ;; Note that any "printable" is also
                    ;; a valid "value".

   base64-char     = ALPHA / DIGIT / "/" / "+"

   base64-4        = 4base64-char

   base64-3        = 3base64-char "="

   base64-2        = 2base64-char "=="

   base64          = *base64-4 [base64-3 / base64-2]

   posit-number = %x31-39 *DIGIT
                    ;; A positive number.

   saslname        = 1*(value-safe-char / "=2C" / "=3D")
                    ;; Conforms to <value>.

   authzid         = "a=" saslname
                    ;; Protocol specific.

   cb-name         = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-")
                     ;; See RFC 5056, Section 7.
                     ;; E.g., "tls-server-end-point" or
                     ;; "tls-unique".

   gs2-cbind-flag  = ("p=" cb-name) / "n" / "y"
                     ;; "n" -> client doesn't support channel binding.
                     ;; "y" -> client does support channel binding
                     ;;        but thinks the server does not.
                     ;; "p" -> client requires channel binding.
                     ;; The selected channel binding follows "p=".

   gs2-header      = gs2-cbind-flag "," [ authzid ] ","
                     ;; GS2 header for OPAQUE

   username        = "n=" saslname
                     ;; Usernames are prepared using SASLprep.

   reserved-mext  = "m=" 1*(value-char)
                     ;; Reserved for signaling mandatory extensions.
                     ;; The exact syntax will be defined in
                     ;; the future.

   channel-binding = "c=" base64
                     ;; base64 encoding of cbind-input.

   cbind-data    = 1*OCTET

   cbind-input   = gs2-header [ cbind-data ]
                     ;; cbind-data MUST be present for
                     ;; gs2-cbind-flag of "p" and MUST be absent
                     ;; for "y" or "n".

   The following definitions are specific to OPAQUE:

   client-first-message-bare =
               [reserved-mext ","] username "," auth-request
               ["," extensions]

   client-first-message = gs2-header client-first-message-bare

   validator = "v=" base64

   server-message-bare =
               [reserved-mext ","] channel-binding "," ksf-params ","
               credentials-response ["," extensions]

   server-message = server-message-bare "," validator

   client-final-message = "p=" base64

9.  Security Considerations

   The KSF parameters and channel bindings aren't authenticated before
   KSF usage, allowing a DoS of a client by an malicious actor posing as
   the server.

   If not used with a secure channel providing confidentiality this
   mechanism leaks the authid and authzid of an authenticating user to
   any passive observer.

   The cryptographic security of this mechanism is not increased over
   the one provided by the underlying OPAQUE algorithm, so all security
   considerations applying to that specification also apply to this one.

10.  Open Issues

   *  OPAQUE allows for a static context to be bound into generated keys
      to prevent cross-protocol and downgrade attacks.  We should
      probably set that to the mechanism name (e.g.  'OPAQUE-A255SHA')

   *  With the current design the KSF parameters can not be MAC-verified
      until after they have been used.  This is bad.  The only other
      option is using the ephemeral keypair to generate a MAC key and
      use that.  This may impact security.

   *  This mechanism should be extended to also become a GSS-API
      mechanism like SCRAM is.

11.  IANA Considerations

   A future revision of this document will request a new registry for
   the OPAQUE family of SASL mechanism, outlining all required details
   on the primitives used by the 'OPAQUE-A255SHA' variant.
